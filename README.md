# Monster Game [![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-unity--game-orange.svg)](https://unity3d.com/)

I haven't come up with a name with this project yet, this is just to mainly expand my knowledge with C#, Unity, game creation, etc.

## About

* It's inspired by Pokemon, with my spin on it (Not using any code/formulas from the original).
* Completely coded from scratch in Unity, special thanks to [Apex](https://twitter.com/RL_Apex) and [Josh](https://twitter.com/j0shht) for helping with some formulas.
* Exploring/Leveling/Battling/RPG based game.
* Quest system (In works)
* Minigame system (In works)
* All models (unless specified otherwise) created in [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/).
* Animations either done in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) or [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com).

## Note

This is my first game that I really worked on in Unity other than the [Roll a Ball](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial) tutorials series Unity has. It's probably not the most well-coded or put together game you've ever seen.
